A school project of a hybrid android application meant for sharing and browsing of different kinds of pictures around the world. The application has a map which allows you to browse any pictures taken around the world, like and comment them or upload your own pictures.

So say you're going on a vacation to Australia and you'd like to see pictures people have taken from Australia, you can use our application to do that!

## Getting Started

[Here's a guide to getting started with ionic.](https://ionicframework.com/getting-started) 
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes;

Download the project as a zip, unzip it and then use your terminal or cmd to **/cd/projectlocationhere** to the folder and first of all write **npm install** to download all the plugins that the application needs! After that write **ionic serve** to run the app on your browser (the browser version might not support all functionalities) and **ionic cordova run android** to get the app on your android phone (on which every function works!)
After that you can freely make a new account, comment, like, upload and most importantly view any new pictures taken anywhere around the world from where-ever you are!

### Prerequisites
Node.js for Ionic
Cordova and Ionic Command line tools
#### If u want to run the application on your phone (I.e use the ionic cordova run android command):
have an up to date version of Java SDK and Android Studio installed on your computer
or ask one of the team members to ionic cordova run the application on your phone
